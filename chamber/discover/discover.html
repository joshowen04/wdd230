            <h2>Las Condes was Founded in 1901 on August 26th</h2>
            <section>

                <p>The decision was made at the request of the owners of estates, who chose the emblem of Las Condes de
                    Sierra
                    Bella. According to some studies, there is the origin of the name of this territorial division.</p>
            </section>
            <h2>Rural History</h2>
            <section>

                <p>Until 1935, the sector maintained its rural character with the cultivation of several of its fields.
                    However,
                    subdivisions appeared that gave rise to the progressive advance of the city towards the east.
                    One of the most important farms was that of San Luis, owned by the then President of the Senate, Mr.
                    Ricardo
                    Matte P√©rez, who ceded it to the Bank of Chile.
                </p>
                <p>In 1907, Ricardo Lyon bought it from the bank and his heirs sold a large part to public charity. The
                    latter,
                    in turn, transferred the land where the Military School was built. Another part of the farm, 71
                    hectares,
                    was sold to the company that created the Los Leones Golf Club.
                    The farm of San Pascual was also of great importance for the area, owned by Pedro Fern√°ndez Concha,
                    the
                    same
                    owner of Hacienda Las Condes. At his death, the succession was sold to Gertrudis Eche√±ique Mujica.
                </p>

            <h2>1920 Towards the Urbanization of the Territory</h2>
            <section>

                <p>In the 1920s, the urbanization of several sectors began. The land was leveled, wide avenues were
                    opened,
                    lines for drinking water, public and private electricity, and gas were laid. Added to this was the
                    construction of elegant houses by prominent architects, such as Alberto Cruz Eyzaguirre.</p>
                <p>Subsequently, the Hacienda Las Condes was subdivided. In 1949, the priests of the Dominican Recoleta
                    sold
                    the Apoquindo farm. This had been involved in litigation since 1936 and, after the sale, was divided
                    into 2,094 sites, receiving the name of Villa Los Dominicos.</p>
                <p>The city had arrived. Its inhabitants quickly promoted a new urban ideal, finding in the area the
                    ideal
                    setting for a new way of life.</p>
                <p>Urban centers were concentrated around sports clubs, such as Golf Club, StadeFran√ßais, Estadio
                    Espa√±ol,
                    Estadio Palestino, which with their public and private parks, generated a network of green lungs in
                    the
                    commune.</p>
                <p>The stadiums of Colonia and their neighborhoods attracted several private schools from foreign
                    congregations, such as Verbo Divino and Villa Mar√≠a Academy, in the 1950s. This allowed the sectors
                    around them to expand.</p>
                <p>By mid-century, Las Condes was already part of the city's fabric and not a neighboring sector. To
                    seal
                    off the development, a modern headquarters for the municipality was built on Avenida Apoquindo.</p>
                <p>At the end of the 20th century, Las Condes is already a fully urbanized commune at the service of its
                    neighbors, with the economy of goods and services being the main one</p>
